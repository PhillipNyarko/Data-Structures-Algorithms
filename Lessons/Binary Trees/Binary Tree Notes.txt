QUESTION 1: As a senior backend engineer at Jovian, you are tasked with developing a fast in-memory data structure
to manage profile information (username, name and email) for 100 million users. It should allow the
following operations to be performed efficiently:

Insert the profile information for a new user.
Find the profile information of a user, given their username
Update the profile information of a user, given their username
List all the users of the platform, sorted by username
You can assume that usernames are unique.

1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input and output formats
    Create a data structure than can manage 100 million different profiles. You must be able to quickly:
    Create and store a new user
    Find the user profile information
    Update the user profile information
    List all the users of the platform sorted by username

    Essentially, create a data structure that can preform store 100 million records and preform insertion, search,
    update, and list operations efficiently.

  Each user is going to be an object of the "User" Class

  The database is also defined as a class with four different functions: insert, find, update, and list_all

2. come up with some example inputs & outputs


Exercise: List some scenarios for testing the class methods insert, search, update and list_all.

Insert:

Inserting into an empty database of users
Trying to insert a user with a username that already exists
Inserting a user with a username that does not exist
Inserting Invalid Value Types

Search:

Attempting to search for a user that doesn't exist
Attempting to search an empty database

Update:

Update a user that doesn't exist
Inputting data in the wrong field

List All:

Calling list all when there are no Users in the database

3. Come Up With a Correct Solution. State it in plain english.

    Store the User objects in a list sorted by username

    create a function for each of the needed tasks

    Insert: Loop through the list and add the new user at a position that keeps the list sorted.
    Find: Loop through the list and find the user object with the username matching the query.
    Update: Loop through the list, find the user object matching the query and update the details
    List: Return the list of user objects.
