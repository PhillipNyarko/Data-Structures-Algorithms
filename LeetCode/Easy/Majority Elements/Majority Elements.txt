1. Given a list of integers, return the value that occurs 50% of the time or higher

2. Example 1:
    Input: nums = [3,2,3]
    Output: 3

   Example 2:
    Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
    Output: 2

3.  Create a frequency table to store the number of each element
    Iterate through the frequency table and return the key that has a value
    that is greater than or equal to half the given list.

4. Time complexity: O(n)
