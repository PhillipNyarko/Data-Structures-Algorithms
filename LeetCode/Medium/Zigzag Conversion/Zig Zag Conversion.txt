1. State the problem clearly
	Given a string and a number of rows, arrange the elements of the string in a zig zag pattern(denoted in the image).
	Then, print the 2D array.

2. Define a sample input and output

Example 1:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
Explaination: 
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R

Example 2:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I

3. 
	a. Create a for loop that goes from 0 to the length of the input string

	b. Create a variable to keep track of the current row (start at 0)

	c. Place each subsequent index of the string in a subsequent list that is in the 2d array moving down,
	up unitl the given number of rows. 
	Store a bool value that will keep track of the current insertion direction (direction = up/down)

	d. If we have reached the number of rows specified, start placing elements 
	backwards until we reach the top. When the direction is up, move up one and to the right one. 
	(switch the direction variable from down to up when the current row equals the number of rows).
	repeat until the end of the input string is reached
