The range function is used with for loops and list to create or iterate over a range of values

The range function in its simplest form, takes in a integer value "n" and will create a sequence of numbers,
    starting form 0, to n-1

The starting value can also be changed from 0 to any number by adding it into the function
    (eg: range(1, 6) -> this will include 1 and end at 5)

The properties of the range function are important to keep in mind when using it for for loops and iterations,
    especially with lists and "n+1" scenarios

For example:

    Lets say you have a lists of length "n". n = the number of elements in your list.
    However, lists indices begin at 0, so to access the last element in your list,
    you would need the n-1th element.
        eg: list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], there are 6 elements and the 6th element is at index 5

    if you have a for loop with a range function to iterate over a list and you do the following
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        ...

    The range function will start at 0, and go to 5.

    But what if you need to check the i + 1 value? Then make sure your function stops ahead of the end by using -1
    If you want to start iterating at 1 instead of 0, but you still want the number of iterations to stay the same
        then you must do for i in range(1, len(list) + 1):
